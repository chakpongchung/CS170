\section*{1. (20 pts.) A greedy algorithm - so to speak}

We can formalize this as a graph problem. Let the undirected graph
 $G = (V,E)$ denote LinkedInœôòùs relationship graph, where each vertex represents a person who has an account on LinkedIn. 
There is an edge $\{u, v\} \in E$ if $u$ and $v$ have listed a professional 
relationship with each other on LinkedIn (we will assume that relationships are symmetric). 
We are looking for a subset $S \subseteq V$ of vertices so that every vertex $s \in S$
 has edges to at least 20 other vertices in $S$. 
And we want to make the set $S$ as large as possible, subject to these constraints.
Design an efficient algorithm to find the set of super-schmoozers (the largest set $S$
 that is consistent with these constraints), given the graph $G$.

\begin{itemize}  
\item[{\bf 1.}] Color each vertex arbitrarily 
\item[{\bf 2.}] Let $B := \{v \in V : v \mbox{ is bad}\}$
\item[{\bf 3.}] While $B \not= \emptyset:$
\item[{\bf 4.}]     Pick any bad vertex $v \in B$
\item[{\bf 5.}]     Reverse the color of $v$.
\item[{\bf 6.}]     Update $B$ to reflect this chang,
so that it again holds the set of bad vertices.
\end{itemize}

\section*{2. (20 pts.) A funky kind of coloring}

Let $G = (V,E)$ be an undirected graph where every vertex has degree $\leq 51$. 
Let's find a way of coloring each vertex blue or gold, so that no vertex
has more than 25 neighbors of its own color.

Consider the following algorithm, where we call a vertex `bad` if it
has more than 25 neighbors of its own color:
